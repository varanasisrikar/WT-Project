        <p align="left" style="color:rgba(72, 63, 126, 0.904); font-weight: 400; font-size: large;">The Machine Learning Department at SIT was founded in 2016. It was designed to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers with a shared interest in statistics and machine learning. The first faculty participants were CSE Department and later we introduced faculty from Biology, Statistics, Philosophy. We created Machine Learning Department due to its academic importance, and its intention to be a leader in helping to shape this rapidly developing field.</p>
        <p align="left" style="color:rgba(72, 63, 126, 0.904); font-weight: 400; font-size: large;">The departmentâ€™s research strategy is to maintain a balance between research into the pure statistical-computational theory of machine learning, and research inventing new algorithms and new problem formulations relevant to practical applications. Our mission is to help lead the development of the discipline of Machine Learning, by perforOur mission is to help lead the development of the discipline of Machine Learning, by performing leading research In this field, by developing and propagating a model academic curriculum for the field, and by helping society to benefit from the knowledge gained by the field.</p>

        <p align="left" style="color:rgba(72, 63, 126, 0.904); font-weight: 400; font-size: large;">
          The Machine Learning Department is made up of a multi-disciplinary team of faculty and students across several academic departments. Machine Learning Department is dedicated to furthering the scientific understanding of automated learning and to producing the next generation of tools for data analysis and decision making based on that understanding. Today's demand for expertise in machine learning far exceeds the supply, and this imbalance will become more severe over the coming decade. Students can also take classes in the Machine Learning Department without being part of one of its academic programs.</p>
